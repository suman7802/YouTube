# YouTube Clone with Next.js

This repository contains a YouTube clone built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The project is designed for learning and exploring Next.js while leveraging your existing React skills. You'll discover how server-side rendering, API routes, and dynamic routing can power your application to create a fast and SEO-friendly user experience.

## Overview

This project replicates core functionalities of YouTube, such as video listing, player interfaces, and search functionalities. While the UI is inspired by YouTube's design, you’re encouraged to experiment and customize components as you learn more about Next.js. As you dive into the code, you’ll encounter:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Enhance SEO and performance by pre-rendering pages.
- **API Routes:** Build your own backend endpoints within Next.js.
- **Dynamic Routing:** Create dynamic pages that render content based on URL parameters.
- **Static Generation:** Use static props and paths to pre-generate pages during build time.

This project is a perfect starting point if you already know React and want to get hands-on experience with Next.js' unique features.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
